Resonace decay reconstruction algorithms with ```VertexCompositeCandiate``` collection in cmssw. Compatible with 2023 PbPb datafomat. The package is fully orthogonal to the ```HiForest``` framework to be combined with other objects.

This branch was edited by Abigail Wesolek and currently will only process events of 

$D^{0} \to K+\pi$

But other branches can easily be added in the future.  You want to check the origianl branch for more information.

The code been edited to produce skimmedEDM and TTree simultaneously.

## How to run

```bash 
#LXplus, bash, cmssw-el8 apptainer

cmsrel CMSSW_13_2_11

cd CMSSW_13_2_11/src
cmsenv

#clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:a-wesole/VertexCP_2023_PbPb_D0_production.git VertexCompositeAnalysis

#run the setup.sh script this will add the HeavyIonsAnalysis from CmsHI github that is needed for centrality 
cd VertexCompositeAnalysis
./setup.sh

#compile
cd ..
scram b -j8

#cd and run code that produces edm and TTree files 
cd VertexCompositeAnalysis/VertexCompositeProducer/test
cmsRun run_edm_and_ttree_DATA.py 


```
