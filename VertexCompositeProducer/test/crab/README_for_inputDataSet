there are 32 scripts here, corresponding to the the 32 datasets of the 2023 data 
each scipt needs the link to the published edm files in DAS

the easiest way to do this is to cd to your crab project directory and edit the 'crab.log'
then you should search for the 'DAS URL' 
the line needed is the one directly above that 


for example 
'''
Output dataset:                 /HIPhysicsRawPrime3/awesolek-HIPhysicsRawPrime3_D0_24July2025-8b581d8886e57c0efd46b0be657273da/USER
Output dataset DAS URL:         https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?input=%2FHIPhysicsRawPrime3%2Fawesolek-HIPhysicsRawPrime3_D0_24July2025-8b581d8886e57c0efd46b0be657273da%2FUSER&instance=prod%2Fphys03
'''


you just include the entire Output dataset in the empty line in the python file.
